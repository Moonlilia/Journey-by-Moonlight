# Introduction

Journey by Moonlight, or JBM, is an adventure-centric modlist for Skyrim SE with an emphasis on roleplaying. A focus on difficulty and survival features reinforces the nature of a harsher world, while carefully-curated visuals serve to mask this under a layer of beauty. Explore the captivating world of Skyrim and create a story all your own!

JBM was created with the goal of not using an ENB, providing better performance and faster loading times. It comes with fully-integrated support for the Spring and Autumn seasons, bringing some change to the world over time while maintaining the cozy and warm aesthetic. JBM even comes with some custom visuals not found anywhere else!

**Journey by Moonlight** comes with additional adult content which is *entirely **optional***. It's enabled by default to allow easier setup for those who wish to use it, but it can be safely disabled. Adult mods are properly-categorized in **Mod Organizer 2** via separators to allow for much easier configuration.

If you would like to check the full list of mods, you can do so on the <a href="https://modwat.ch/u/Moonlilia/plugins">Modwatch</a> page

# Requirements

**Journey by Moonlight** was made with performance in mind. However, it's difficult to narrow down the minimum specs needed. You can adjust INI files as desired to fine-tune performance further. Note that JBM is locked to **60 FPS** by default.

<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><a id="user-content-recommended-specs" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#recommended-specs"><svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"><path d="m7.775 3.275 1.25-1.25a3.5 3.5 0 1 1 4.95 4.95l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 0 1-4.95 0 .751.751 0 0 1 .018-1.042.751.751 0 0 1 1.042-.018 1.998 1.998 0 0 0 2.83 0l2.5-2.5a2.002 2.002 0 0 0-2.83-2.83l-1.25 1.25a.751.751 0 0 1-1.042-.018.751.751 0 0 1-.018-1.042Zm-4.69 9.64a1.998 1.998 0 0 0 2.83 0l1.25-1.25a.751.751 0 0 1 1.042.018.751.751 0 0 1 .018 1.042l-1.25 1.25a3.5 3.5 0 1 1-4.95-4.95l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 0 1 4.95 0 .751.751 0 0 1-.018 1.042.751.751 0 0 1-1.042.018 1.998 1.998 0 0 0-2.83 0l-2.5 2.5a1.998 1.998 0 0 0 0 2.83Z"></path></svg></a><strong>Recommended Specs</strong></h3>

</table>

These are the *recommended specs* as they match those that the modlist was built and tested on. Your mileage may vary if specs are different. On these specs with the default settings for JBM, I get a smooth 60 FPS with a drop of 1 or 2 FPS in heavier areas like Falkreath. With this in mind, systems that are slightly weaker shouldn't have issues with running this modlist.

## Besides this, you will need:

 * 300 GB to download and install
 * 196 GB to finalize
 * <a href="https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe">Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package</a>
 * <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/5.0/runtime">Microsoft .NET 5.0</a>

<img src="https://github.com/Moonlilia/Journey-by-Moonlight/assets/137309555/97c4dd83-2e3a-46c4-b597-160f41c96d8b" width="300" height="300">

You may not need to download from the above links as they've likely been installed already but it won't hurt to check - they are required after all. After a successful download, and when you've verified the game launches and runs, you can clear your **downloads** folder to free up additional space. This will likely change over time as mods are added and/or removed.

### Pagefile Configuration

This will allow Wabbajack to handle installing the modlist with ease but *may* not be necessary. It's highly-recommended to do so if you haven't before.

1. Press **Windows + R** on your Keyboard
2. Type **sysdm.cpl ,3** and press **Enter**
3. Under **Performance**, click **Settings**
4. Click **Advanced** at the top
5. In the **Virtual Memory** section, click **Change...**
6. Disable **Automatically manage paging file size for all drives**
7. Click **Custom Size** and set minimum to at least **20480**, and maximum to at least **40960** if needed
   	- Do this for the drive you're installing JBM to
8. Click **Set**
9. Click **Apply** and **Ok**
10. Restart your system

Again, this step is *highly-recommended*. It's a risk you take if you choose to skip this step.

# Installation

This modlist is installed via <a href="https://www.wabbajack.org/">**Wabbajack**</a>, a popular and innovative tool which makes modlist installations incredibly simple. Please be sure to do the following steps:

1. Have a clean install of Skyrim on Steam. This means it has **no additional or missing** files. If you've modded Skyrim before, and it involved adding to the game folder directly, you can reinstall to ensure it's properly-cleaned.

2. ***Importantly***, ensure your Skyrim install is **not** located in **Program Files**. You can do this by navigating through **Steam > Settings > Storage** and clicking the + to the right of your existing libraries. Then, while in this menu, tick the box next to Skyrim, click **Move**, and move it to the new location.
   
3. After a clean install, run Skyrim at least once. You can load to the main menu and close right after. This generates some necessary files.

4. Install **Wabbajack**. You can click the link at the top of this category to get started.

## Wabbajack Installation

Once you've done these steps, you can proceed with installing the modlist. Make sure you have Wabbajack installed by this point! You will need to do some prepwork for this step as well, though it's not as bad. You can read these below:

 1. Create some folders for Wabbajack to make use of. Preferably, name them as follows:
      * Journey by Moonlight - Placing this on an SSD is recommended but not required
      * JBM Downloads - Placing this on a separate drive is recommended but not required
            * This is where **all** files you download *manually* need to go, otherwise Wabbajack may not recognize them.
        
 2. Assign these folders in Wabbajack. To do so, follow these steps or refer to the image below:
      * Open Wabbajack and click **Install From Disk**
      * Click the 3 dots (...) next to **Modlist Installation Location** and navigate to your **Journey by Moonlight** folder
      * Click the 3 dots (...) next to **Resource Download Location** and navigate to your **JBM Downloads** folder
        
<img src="https://github.com/Moonlilia/Journey-by-Moonlight/assets/137309555/7ece10a5-a319-4a98-b6dc-243a644dbefb" width="900" height="200">

 3. Additionally, please ensure you have accounts for the following websites:
      * <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/">Nexus</a> - A **Premium** subscription is highly-recommended for a faster download
      * <a href="https://www.loverslab.com/">LoversLab</a>
      * <a href="https://www.vectorplexis.com/">VectorPlexis</a>

Some files from **LoversLab** and **VectorPlexis** can be installed from the <a href="https://discord.gg/97WvxJp47p">Discord</a> server. However, some will *need* to be installed from the website due to Discord's file size restrictions. A full list of the mods from each **non-Nexus** site can also be found in the server.

4. Sign into these accounts on Wabbajack by clicking the Settings icon (The Cog Wheel) in the top-right.

## Modlist Installation

1. With these steps taken care of, you can begin downloading **Journey by Moonlight**! The steps and notes below explain this process:

 * Download the .zip file from JBM's <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/94658">Nexus</a> page
      * Extract the file to your **Wabbajack** folder
      * Inside Wabbajack, click the 3 dots (...) next to **Target Modlist** and select the **Journey By Moonlight.wabbajack** file

2. This should complete the preparation steps. Now, click the **Resume** button (the triangle in a circle) in Wabbajack to begin downloading the modlist. Some files will need to be downloaded manually. In such cases, it should open a popup to download the mod from, with a guide at the top to tell you which file(s) to download from that page. Links to each mod are also available in the Discord server, as well as downloads for those below **50 MB**. Simply move them to your **JBM Downloads** folder.

3. You may run into errors while installing the modlist. Wabbajack should tell you which mod it failed on. If rerunning Wabbajack doesn't fix the issue, you can visit the Discord server for a list of links to mods which may have been missed.

4. ***If you run into any issues during the installation process, please consider joining the Discord server and sending a message there.*** :)

5. If the installation is successful, you can create a shortcut for Mod Organizer's .exe in the **Journey by Moonlight** folder.

6. Now for some final steps - choosing the right INI files for your system. Download **JBM - INI Files** from the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/94658">Nexus</a> page and extract it to a new folder or open the archive.
     1. Open the **Profile INIs** folder and choose your resolution. Note that 1920x1080 can work on larger resolution screens as well and is more performance-friendly.
          * From there, choose your preferred settings. High and Medium have little difference in visuals but Medium yields more FPS
          * Then, transfer all 3 files (Skyrim.ini, SkyrimCustom.ini, and SkyrimPrefs.ini) to **Journey by Moonlight > Profile > Default**
            
     2. Open the **Priority INIs** folder and choose your total CPU cores. Open the MO2 instance for the modlist as well!
          * In MO2, navigate to the **High Priority - Modlist Files** separator and the **JBM - Skyrim Priority** mod
          * Right-click the mod and click **Open in Explorer**, navigate **SKSE > Plugins** and drop it in there, replacing the existing file
          * Refer to the image below for assistance

     3. Last step! Getting Skyrim Upscaler to work on your system, or disabling it.
          1. Head to <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/502">UpscalerBasePlugin</a> on **Nexus** and download a DLL to match your GPU
         		* **RTX** users should download **DLSS** for <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/80343">Skyrim Upscaler</a> to work
          		* **Non-RTX** users should verify that their card *supports* **DirectX 12** and, if so, download FSR2 or XeSS
           		* If downloading FSR2, head to the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ae5T8rubejwbqklP_V9s3iJKlCX4KFxu">Google Drive</a> instead
             		* If your card *does not* support **DirectX 12**, disable **Skyrim Upscaler** in MO2 and delete the **UpscalerBasePlugin** folder in **Journey by Moonlight > Stock Game > Data**
          2. Add the newly-downloaded DLL, or DLLs if using FSR2, to **Journey by Moonlight > Stock Game > Data > UpscalerBasePlugin** and delete **nvngx_dlss.dll**
          3. Next, open up **JBM - INI Files** and **Upscaler INIs**, choose based on the DLL you're using and preference for level of **quality** and **performance**
          4. Then, in MO2, drop the chosen INI file into **JBM - Skyrim Priority > SKSE > Plugins**
          		* If you would like to verify that it matches, go in-game and press **End** to open the menu, then look through the options
          5. If your screen is shaky, enabling borderless in **SkyrimPrefs.ini** can help resolve the issue

If you don't know how many cores your CPU has, open Task Manager (Ctrl + Alt = Del) and navigate to **Performance**.
 * You should see a utilization monitor with some information below. Look for **Cores** and **Logical Processors**. Refer to the image below for help.

<img src="https://github.com/Moonlilia/Journey-by-Moonlight/assets/137309555/d2bec486-0655-4fad-b27a-ae2f97c5ff34" width="600" height="520">

With these steps finished, you should now be able to proceed with launching the game!

# Starting Your Playthrough

1. Starting the game should be easy enough. **Always** launch the game through the MO2 instance located in your **Journey by Moonlight** folder. Ensure that you open the game through SKSE in MO2, refer to the image below for assistance:

<img src="https://github.com/Moonlilia/Journey-by-Moonlight/assets/137309555/0f9dfe38-0023-4f13-a5b5-72b93e482743" width="800" height="600">

2. After creating a new game, you should be confronted first with an introduction screen with the game title, followed by a view over a Helgen in ruins.
     * If you're okay with a fully random start, you can simply press **Enter**.
     * If you'd like to customize it, press **Esc** and open the **MCM** menu. Open **0. Skyrim Unbound** to configure it to your liking and click **Begin Adventure** when done to continue on with character creation.
  
3. Once you've created your character and chosen your preferred pronouns, you should do 2 things...
     1. Open MCM again, click on **- MCM Recorder**, and select the various recordings. Follow the popup prompts and repeat this step until all recordings have played.
     2. Go through the various MCM menus. If you've done Step 1, you *can* skip this step if you're okay with JBM's default settings.
          * If you'd like more customization, it's recommended to go through all options from 0 through 3D - Other options can be used but aren't needed.
              * Options in 0S show up only if you have OStim and its content enabled.
              * A brief description of each number can be seen below - a more thorough description is available in the Discord server.
<img src="https://github.com/Moonlilia/Journey-by-Moonlight/assets/137309555/a55b32bc-8c14-492e-a9df-7e571f42e3ac" width="600" height="350">

After you've set up your game to fit your preferences, you can now proceed with the game! Press **Enter** and select the prompt to start your playthrough.

*If you need any help or run into any issues, feel free to post them in the Discord server. There's sure to be bugs but we can all work on fixing them together* :)

# Optional Content 

***Journey by Moonlight** makes use of a wide array of content which is fully-optional and easily-configurable. They alter difficulty and may even make the game more accessible.*
	- *Read below for a list of what kind of optional content is included and why*
	- *Again, all options here can be disabled **safely** without consequence*
	- *All optional content will have a separator marked **[Optional]** in MO2*
	
## Difficulty 
- **Experience - Slow Your Roll** - Slows the leveling curve to make each level feel *rewarding*
- **Weight** - Options modify weight for coins and overall carry weight (harsher than SunHelm) to encourage planning and decision-making 
- *If **Weight A Minute** is enabled, **DO NOT** enable SunHelm's carry weight modifier!
- *SunHelm also provides carry weight for arrows, which can be disabled if preferred*
- **Regen Cap** - Specifically configured to slow health regen significantly, can be altered easily however
- **Sinister Seven** - Adds new bosses which will hunt you down as you grow stronger
	- *Comes with quest entry changes made by me for more immersion
	- *Also includes a recording in **MCM Recorder** for a special configuration
		
	### Combat
	- **Wounds** - Adds combat injuries, specially-configured to not be a total hassle
	- **Know Your Enemy Redux** - Overhauls creature strengths, weaknesses, and resistances
		- *Comes with its Armor addon to encourage a diverse build, but not necessarily require it like other mods with the same goal*
	- **Shadow of Skyrim** - A death overhaul, favoring robbery over death. Highly-configurable and recommended to view before Starting
		- *Disabled by **Default** but notifies you at the start of the game*
	
## OStim
- **OStim** content is supported in JBM. It's enabled by default but can be safely and easily-disabled for those who'd prefer not to.
	- OStim content is given its own categories in MO2
- Additionally provides a 'SFW' option called **OFadeToBlack**, removing scenes and replacing them with a black screen instead
- Animation packs were chosen for inclusivity but should work for anyone
	
## Arachnophobia
- **Insects Begone** - Replaces spiders with bears and chaurus with skeevers. Enabled by default and recommended to leave as such, but can be disabled
	- Justification - JBM uses **Bears of the North** and **Immersive Sound Compendium**'s bear audio overhaul. This makes them ***much*** more terrifying
	- So, in short, recommended to keep enabled for a more immersive and scarier enemy type :)
- **SkyTEST Redux - Insects Begone** - A patch made by me which removes *all* small spider spawns from the game
	
## Cheats
- **AddItemMenu** - Provided for those who wish to obtain items without needing to find them or use console, disabled by default
