# Introduction

Journey by Moonlight, or JBM, is an adventure-centric modlist for Skyrim SE with an emphasis on roleplaying. A focus on difficulty and survival features reinforces the nature of a harsher world, while carefully-curated visuals serve to mask this under a layer of beauty. Explore the captivating world of Skyrim and create a story all your own!

JBM was created with the goal of not using an ENB, providing better performance and faster loading times. It comes with fully-integrated support for the Spring and Autumn seasons, bringing some change to the world over time while maintaining the cozy and warm aesthetic. JBM even comes with some custom visuals not found anywhere else!

**Journey by Moonlight** comes with additional adult content which is *entirely **optional***. It's enabled by default to allow easier setup for those who wish to use it, but it can be safely disabled. Adult mods are properly-categorized in **Mod Organizer 2** via separators to allow for much easier configuration.

# Requirements

**Journey by Moonlight** was made with performance in mind. However, it's difficult to narrow down the minimum specs needed. You can adjust INI files as desired to fine-tune performance further. Note that JBM is locked to **60 FPS** by default.

These are the *recommended specs* as they match those that the modlist was built and tested on. Your mileage may vary if specs are different. On tehse specs with the default settings for JBM, I get a smooth 60 FPS with a drop of 1 or 2 FPS in heavier areas like Falkreath. With this in mind, systems that are slightly weaker shouldn't have issues with running this modlist.

## Besides this, you will need:

 * 300 GB to download and install
 * 196 GB to finalize
 * <a href="https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe">Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package</a>
 * <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/5.0/runtime">Microsoft .NET 5.0</a>

You may not need to download from the above links as they've likely been installed already but it won't hurt to check - they are required after all. After a successful download, and when you've verified the game launches and runs, you can clear your **downloads** folder to free up additional space. This will likely change over time as mods are added and/or removed.

# Installation

This modlist is installed via <a href="https://www.wabbajack.org/">**Wabbajack**</a>, a popular and innovative tool which makes modlist installations incredibly simple. Please be sure to do the following steps:

* Have a clean install of Skyrim on Steam. This means it has **no additional or missing** files. If you've modded Skyrim before, and it involved adding to the game folder directly, you can reinstall to ensure it's properly-cleaned.
* ***Importantly***, ensure your Skyrim install is **not** located in **Program Files**. You can do this by navigating through **Steam > Settings > Storage** and clicking the + to the right of your existing libraries.
* After a clean install, run Skyrim at least once. You can load to the main menu and close right after. This generates some necessary files.

## Wabbajack Installation

Once you've done these steps, you can proceed with installing the modlist. Make sure you have Wabbajack installed by this point! You will need to do some prepwork for this step as well, though it's not as bad. You can read these below:

 * Create some folders for Wabbajack to make use of. Preferably, name them as follows:
      * Journey by Moonlight
      * Wabbajack
      * JBM Downloads
 * Refer to the image below if needed

 * Download the .zip file from JBM's <a href=" ">Nexus</a> page
      * Extract the file to your **Wabbajack** folder
      * Inside Wabbajack, click the 3 dots (...) and select the **JourneyByMoonlight.wabbajack** file
